## Versvs

Versvs was a group collaboration with [Sam Sakhavarz](https://github.com/samsakhavarz) and [Mikey Couture](https://github.com/MikeyCouture). We used the [Goodreads API](https://www.goodreads.com/api) to filter through works by a chosen author to display stats on their works over the years.

We used React.js and Firebase to host the project.

Versvs can be seen live [here](https://versvs-2385d.firebaseapp.com/).
